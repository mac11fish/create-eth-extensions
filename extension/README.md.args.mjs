export const extraContents = `## ðŸŽ² Setup RANDAO Extension

This extension shows how to use on-chain randomness using RANDAO for truly on-chain unpredictable random sources.

Ethereum PoS introduces randomness using block.mixHash (prevRandao). Look at [EIP-4399](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4399) for more information.

### Setup

Deploy your contract running \`\`\`yarn deploy\`\`\`

### Testing the random generator

Start the front-end with \`\`\`yarn start\`\`\` and go to the _/randao_ page to get more information and interact with your deployed RandomGenerator contract.
